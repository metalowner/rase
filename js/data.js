    <h1>9 Days In Paradise</h1><h2>(Part 1 - Communiation)</h2>

    <p>It was 5am in the cold Russian December, few days before 2019. 
    The cold didn't bother me, wasn't even on my mind. She met me at the airport. First contact after a month of separation. A strong hug and passionate kiss made me forget the problems of my insane life. All I wanted was to be with her in that moment.</p>

    <p>During the drive to our place it got very hot in the taxi. Yet, the driver didn't say a word (thank you!) while we were having some fun on the back seat. I think it was the best drive of my life. As soon as we arrived we decided to walk her dog. A cute yet crazy little fellow named Dick.</p>

    <p>I usually consider a walk as a great thing. Keeps me energetic and allows to think, talk or listen. This time we talked while walking. Dick was a distraction, running around constantly pulling her. Lucky we know to handle distractions.</p>

    <p>The key to high quality communication is seperation of concerns. Doing one thing at a time. Most difficult is to listen to her beautiful voice, see her body language and facial expressions, without thinking of sex.</p>

    <p>Body language and facial expressions are usually a reflection of the inner state. They are driven subconsciously by emotions and are very difficult to fake. In addition, emotions are extremely contagious. Our mind perceives subconsciously the emotions other people experience. As a result people around us have a lot of influence on what we feel.</p>

    <p>Practice your emotional hygiene, by reducing communication with people in negative states. An example can be ego maniacs seeking attention. Those little people talking about how shitty everything is, without a glimpse of will to make a change.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I went off topic. It's me, her and Dick back at our place. The quality of the conversation was low. Just general thaughts and talks of ordinary activities. Most likely sex thaughts got in the way. So, I am making coffee while Dick is being washed after the walk.</p>

    <p>When you are too horny to hold a conversation in your relationship the solution is... Sex. Nothing surprising about that. But not just any kind of sex. I am talking about high quality one. When both of you actively search and press pleasure points. The first two days were dedicated to improving our communication.</p>

  <h1>9 Days In Paradise</h1><h2>(Part 2 - Teamwork)</h2>

  <p>Today is the 31st of December, new years eve' is approaching. We decided on BBQ and Olivier salad as our celebration meal. Champagne is a tradition of the new year celebration so we got pink Martini. As for the dessert, this is a classic cognac experience. Which I will explain in details later.</p>

  <p>When you have tasks, it is important to cooperate effectively. Shopping is a great example, many couples I know, have trouble shopping together. The reasons that can make mutual shopping a challenge are endless. But these are all symptoms of one basic problem, consideration. Just consider your partners' feelings, and make efforts to improve the experience for the both of you.</p>

  <p>Making BBQ without proper equipment in the snow is quite a challenge. While I was in charge of the BBQ she took the role of Captain Wine, passing me the bottle every few minutes. After an hour we were in a good mood with an awesome piece of meat. That's what I call great teamwork.</p>

  <p>We are back in the apartment. Taking turns to cut the Olivier ingredients while distracting each other with displays of love. I guess making food together is a special activity. It can be an individual task or mutual experience. The choice depends on the both of you.</p>

  <p>High quality relationship requires both sides to constantly invest time and effort into it. Otherwise, it wont last long.</p>

  <p>Anyway, again I am off the topic. The meal is ready and we filled a bath to relax in together. But before that, there is a Russian wish making tradition I would like to share with you.</p>

  <h3>New Years' Wish - Russian Style</h3>
  <p>After the presidents' speech, while the Moscow clock hits the bells of midnight, you need to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the champagne and pour into the glasses.</li>
    <li>Write your wish on a small piece of paper.</li>
    <li>Burn the paper into the champagne glass and drink it all.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In our case I am pretty sure we didn't make it on time. But we had lots of fun without it. If you ask me, most things become bullshit when you are happy together. The way I see it, it is all about the relationship and what you do with it.</p>

  <h1>9 Days In Paradise</h1><h2>(Part 3 - Pleasure)</h2>

  <p>We are done with the wish making. Then, the fireworks started. A few kilometers of the night sky was covered with fireworks for over 10 minutes. I believe it took hundreds of people to make that happen. We were seeing everything through our kitchen window. With champagne and cigarettes we were toasting to our happiness, together. From my perspective, it was a breath taking view with the woman I love by my side, a great start for a new year.</p>

  <p>The display of lights is over. So, it is bath relaxation time. I was captain champagne and cigarettes, while she was feeding me one of the best Oliviers I ever had. We were talking, laughing and mainly relaxing. This was a moment of pleasure for the both of us.</p>

  <p>It got way too hot in the bath and the champagne is gone. So, we decided to move to the kitchen. We were full from the BBQ and salad so now it is time for dessert. Do you remember I told you I will explain about the classic cognac experience? Well, it is time.</p>

  <h3>Classic Cognac Experience</h3>
  <p>Or in other words, how to set up a great date. When drinking cognac always remember the 4Cs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cognac</li>
    <li>Chocollate</li>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Cigarettes / Cigar</li>
  </ul>

  <p>*Cheese will refresh your taste, recommended to consume between different types of cognac.</p>

  <p>So here is an idea for a great date. Mix in some romantic atmosphere and this might become one of the best dates ever.</p>

  <p>That night she called me a magician.</p>

  <h1>9 Days In Paradise</h1><h2>(Part 4 - Effort)</h2>

  <p>When you invest time and effort effectively, people start saying it is talent, luck or magic. That way they can demolish your efforts and make themselves feel less lazy. Everything you do requires effort to do it well. This even made me angry at some point. After years of practice to be called lucky or talented is anoying. But then, it is better, than to be called a failure that after so many years of practice can do only that much.</p>

  <p>Modern people are lazy. Everything can be easy with money. So, we constantly look for shortcuts to our goals. But, shortcuts make you weak and your resolve fragile. What happened to the old school fighting spirit?</p>

  <p>There are too many distractions. It's not that there is no fighting spirit left in people. It's just that people can't decide where to put that spirit. Because, there is no time to think when you constantly need to perform.</p>

  <p>There are too many ways to live your life. That is why life is never truly satisfying. Especially when you know it could be better and not doing enough to make it happen.</p>

  <p>There are professional solutions and courses on decision making which I will share with you some other time. But for now, what I want you to take from this part, is the fact that you need to make efforts in order to maintain and improve a relationship.</p>

  <p>The first day of 2019 was about maintaining alcohol levels and rest. The restaurant from a few days ago gave me a dessert idea. So, I took some ice cream, mixed it with chocolate and poured some cognac on top. Her delighted reaction was even better than the taste of the dessert. We watched animes, ate and chilled.</p>

  <p>It was another day in paradise.</p>

  <h1>9 Days In Paradise</h1><h2>(Part 5 - Opportunities)</h2>

  <p>Today she went the extra mile for me. Unexpected pleasures are the key for excellence. These moments are opportunities. If you show your appreciation and give compliments, the both of you will have a great time. She might even surprise you more often afterwards. Otherwise, if you wont notice her effort, take it for granted or your ego prevents you from complimenting; she will get hurt and will never want to go the extra mile for you again.</p>

  <p>Logic is great, but decisions are made emotionally. You feel something is good or bad, only then your logic explains what made you feel that way. So, it doesn't matter if you explain yourself later, the opportunity has already passed.</p>

  <p>The key difference between people who are able to make great things happen and those that don't is <b>resourcefulness</b>. It is the ability to locale your resources and use them to generate solutions. Unless severe mental disorders get in the way, resourcefulness is a skill that can be trained and improve your problem solving ability.</p>

  <p>In our modern world machines are gradualy replacing labor. Many people choose to get sad about the fact that their job might be replaced by a machine with time. However, the one most important skill any major company is looking for is resourcefulness. This is a unique quality of people, generating <b>new and better</b> solutions. Train your resourcefulness for better relationships and career.</p>

  <p>You will never regret investing in yourself.</p>

  <h1>9 Days In Paradise</h1><h2>(Part 6 - Love & Sadness)</h2>

  <p>Today is the last day in paradise. We both feel sad about it and concentrate on other things, in order to avoid unnecessary tears. We order a cab, eat and drive to the airport. The view was fantastic, light pink sky over plain white snowy fields.</p>

  <p>This time saying goodbye tears my heart into pieces. A feeling of sadness and loneliness strikes me while we are still together. During both flights home, I am writing about our time together. Then, it hits me; I am feeling love, maybe for the first time.</p>

  <p>Why did I not see that I am feeling love while I was there? This question bugged me for a while, until I figured the answer. We felt great while together and experienced many positive emotions. But all the excitment and fun were gone when we had to say goodbye. Left with sadness and loneliness, it was easy to see a strong positive emotion.</p>

  <p>So, my conclusion is that previous generations were right by saying; you can't have the good without the bad. Many people I met see sadness, loneliness and fear as bad feelings that should not be experienced or shown to anybody. But these are just other types of our natural feelings. Designed by evolution to help us survive. Shutting them down or ignoring them is equivalent to ignoring problems in your life and just letting it fall apart.</p>

  <p>Accept your feelings, these are a major part defining who you really are and what are your needs.</p>
